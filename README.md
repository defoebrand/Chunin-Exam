> This project is a take-home assessment. The task was to build a URL shortener. I have used StimulusJS / Rails / SQLite3 to set up a key-value database system of unique short URL keys for each unique URL

# The Big Short 

## Project Description

This project is a simple URL shortener designed to account for variances in http:// and www. beginnings to common URLs. While https:// and http:// are stored separately, www.google.com and google.com are not. Each unique URL is assigned a 10 character key. Each 10 character key is randomly generated from upper and lower case letters, as well as all digits. Inputting the exact same URL will return the same short key every time.
